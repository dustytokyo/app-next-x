# - In this folder, four different next.js-based apps should be newly created.

# - Use pnpm to create the apps.

# - Different apps are for comparing different UI libraries shown below.

# - The different UI liraries to use and name to be given:
## 1. Google's MUI as 'app-next-mui',
## 2. Material Tailwind as 'app-next-mt',
## 3. TailGrids as 'app-next-tg', and
## 4. Vercel's Flowbite as 'app-next-fb'.

# - Simply add '/mytest' path within each app that contains a stylized button that opens a modal window which simply says  'hello!'.

# - The button should be created within 'storybook'.

# - Simple tests for the button with tools like 'jest' or headless 'playground' would be appreciated as well.

# - Include 'eslint' and 'prettier' in each of the apps.
